📘 Analyzing Forward Runs With Tracking Data



UEFA Champions League Final 2023 — Manchester City vs Inter Milan



This project uses tracking-derived player run data to analyse forward runs, average movement patterns, and variation in run direction from the 2023 Champions League final.



The code produces visualisations such as:



Final-third forward runs for a single player



Team-wide run patterns (average direction + directional variation)



Comparisons between forwards (Haaland, Lukaku, Lautaro)



Optional: possessions with xG → visualising runs + passing chains



The project is part of a larger analysis repo:
