Three rounds of Eliteserien are finished. We've started to get a picture of how the teams look, who's going to battle for medals, and who's going to fight for avoiding relegation. After three rounds, 58 goals have been scored. Of these, 12 goals have come from set pieces. Which team is the most dangerous on set pieces so far, and how good is each team at creating scoring chances on set pieces? The answer to these questions could help decide the medal race and who ultimately gets relegated. In this article, I'll examine how many chances/expected goals(xG) each team has created from set pieces so far. The figures are taken from [fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/nb/leagues/59/matches/eliteserien), which uses data from opta.

ODD has created by far the most (2.49 xG). RBK, KFUM, Bodø-Glimt and FFK have all created more than one expected goal. Sandefjord, Kristiansund and Molde have all created very little on their set pieces. It's surprising to see so few chances on goal, even after three rounds of the series. To get a better idea of how good each team is at creating chances on set pieces, we should also look at the amount of set pieces. I've chosen to examine corners more closely (it's important to bear in mind that xG from set pieces also includes free kicks).

There are obviously already big differences in the number of corners for each team. From Brann's 35! corners to Sandefjord's 4 (one less game). LSK and Odd also have a double-digit number of corners in one match, and just two in another. A better opponent will often mean fewer corners (LSK with only two corners at home against Bodø-Glimt). This makes it difficult to produce a lot of xG in total in the match, but the corners you get will become even more important.

Sorting by accumulated xG, we see that it's only RBK among the top five teams that "deserved" an extra set piece goal. The others have been paid more or less as expected. Further down the table, Haugesund have been effective and have scored 1.5 goal more than they have produced. Interestingly, Sandefjord have scored two goals from set pieces after 0.06 xG and have only had four corners (of course they've had free kicks as well, but both their goals came from corners). Here we need more data to see if Sandefjord can continue to score goals from corners, or if they've just been incredibly lucky. The numbers indicate the latter, because it's unlikely to score many goals from small chances over a long period of time. When you look at the Sandefjord example, many people wonder whether xG is relevant at all. One should take statistics after only three rounds with one team. Statistics from just three rounds(small dataset) should be taken with a large pinch of salt, as the data is sparse and there can be considerable variance. However, over time the numbers will be a strong indicator of goal scoring chances, and often the xG table ends up being very similar to the number of goals table. The skilled teams on set pieces (read [this](https://n0rthface43.github.io/Ball/set%20piece/Caseanalyse-Brentford-dodballer/)) about Brentford) are anything but random, but creating consistent high xG numbers from set piece over time. Brentford are able to do this despite their opponents playing in the Champions League. It's very effective, and its obviuos all teams in the eliteserien have a lot to gain here.

Accumulated set pieces xG divided by the number of corners gives us an even clearer picture of their effectiveness from set pieces. ODD is still clearly creating the most.  


#### Margins to gain

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![FFK0,15xG_1 1 1](https://github.com/n0rthface43/Ball/assets/157420543/5110a821-3aa6-4745-b386-8eeb971e1e79)   | ![Brann kartum0,04xG_1 1 1](https://github.com/n0rthface43/Ball/assets/157420543/49df50df-4e62-47d0-b318-2d1528a47537) 

Sørløkk's shot having an xG that is 0.08 higher. 0.08 might sound insignificant, but over time, it can and certainly will lead to slightly better chances and more goals. We see from the images that Sørløkk has a much greater chance of scoring on his opportunity than Kartum does. When Odd, on average, creates 0.144 xG per set piece, it actually represents a slightly better opportunity than Sørløkk's shot. In comparison, when Brann averages 0.027 xG per set piece, it represents an even smaller chance than Kartum's shot. Over a season, this can contribute to tipping the scales for medals one way or determining who plays in the OBOS league next year.

Summary
So far, Odd has produced by far the most xG from their set pieces. FFK, RBK, and Bodø/Glimt have also created some good scoring opportunities. Most teams have been rewarded approximately in line with the xG they have accumulated. Some teams have done better (Haugesund and Sandefjord), while RBK should have had at least one set piece goal. The number of corners varies, giving some teams more opportunities to create from set pieces than they have managed. When considering the number of corners, Odd and FFK still stand out positively, while Molde, LSK, and Brann show signs of significant improvement potential. The data set is a bit thin with only three rounds played, increasing the likelihood of variance with teams scoring much more (Sandefjord and Haugesund) or less (RBK) than the chances they have accumulated. It will be interesting to see how this develops as more data becomes available and also to take a closer look at what each team does on their set pieces.
