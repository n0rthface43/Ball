### Using tracking data - analyzing runs 
------------
Through the soccermatics pro course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which lead to this report where I analyse attack running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, I chose my favourite Jack Grealish. Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, so it was in this match.

Grealish’s runs indicate a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes must provide width.

Zooming out, Nathan Aké’s average wide run makes sense, knowing Grealish often runs inside. Starting his runs closer to goal than Bernardo Silva on the right, Grealish creates a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns.

Silva’s variation in run direction is second of all players in the match; Only Henrikh Mkhitaryan has more mixed run directions. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle in run directions and visualized with wedges for each player. High variation indicates players running in a wider range of directions, showing more unpredictability. Low variation means the run direction is more consistent. This could be due to players have a more specialized role in the team. Bernardo Silva for has a high variation, which means his runs were in multiple directions. This observation supports the bias about him as a player that operates in a lot of spaces and moving all over the pitch. Lukaku however, have a lower variation, meaning he is running more in the same direction and have less variation in his running direction. This can be due to a specialized role in his team. In his case his runs forward(we have filtered for forward runs), and his average running direction is close to equal with running towards the opposition goal.

Noticing the difference in run variation between Lukaku and his counterpart Lautaro Martínez is interesting.  Lukaku’s low variation indicates he has a more specialized role, and Lautaro more flexible, making more runs in multiple directions.
