Through the Soccermatics course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which led to this article where I analyse running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a certain tall blonde Norwegian in Citys front line, I chose to investigate my favourite Jack Grealish. In addition to examining Grealish's runs, I also introduce a metric that quantifies variation in run direction.
<div style="text-align:center;">

Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s ability to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, and so they were in this final. According to the data from respovision, Grealish managed 11 forward runs (while City were in possession) through the match. 
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8504e061-0758-4f61-9f7e-d6816372a193" alt="L4" style="max-width:80%;"/>

Grealish played in the final as a left winger. His runs show a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes has to provide width. Despite all his forward runs, Grealish had surprisingly few direct involvements with the ball in City's chance creation. Most City's chances came with runs through the middle, or underlaps like Bernardo Silva did before Rodri's goal. Examining Grealish's runs in situations where City actually created chances adds valuable context to his role. Here is one example:
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e5d568-7488-4ed0-8b37-ef212187ac84" alt="L4" style="max-width:80%;"/>
</div>

This situation ended with a shot from De Bruyne (ball disappeared, tracking data is not perfect yet:)). In this short sequence, Grealish's run contributes to creating space for De Bruyne. Grealish runs wide, maintaining the width on the left flank. Inter’s left-back (Darmian) hesitates to press De Bruyne, aware that doing so would free up Grealish. In addition, Dias’ run also draws defenders’ attention, creating more time for De Bruyne. Brozovic arrives late, allowing De Bruyne enough space to move inside and take the shot.   
### Run direction variations
Looking at the whole team (figure below), Nathan Aké’s average run goes wide. That can make sense, knowing that Grealish often runs inside. Grealish starting his runs closer to the opposition goal than his counterpart Bernardo Silva on the right, creating a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns. With Silva operating deeper in midfield, the responsibility for stretching the opposition defence on the right side shifts. Average runs indicate that Silva, De Bruyne, Akanji and Stones share this task on their side.
<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

Back to Bernardo Silva, he gives an impression of running wherever the space occurs on the pitch. This impression is reflected in the variation metric. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle of running directions, and visualized with wedges/cones for each player. High variation indicates a player running in a wider range of directions (Silva and Grealish), which can add unpredictability to the team’s attack.  Low variation suggests a more consistent, specialized running pattern. 
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847cdd11-0f06-4c4a-b703-8e489e77fea2" alt="git3" width="45%" />

</div>
For players in similar roles, comparason can can provide insights about their style of play. Lukaku, with lower variation, running more consistently in same direction (towards goal). Haaland, running in a more wider angle of directions. This makes it more difficult for the defenders following his runs. The wide angle runs will sometimes also move him away from the centre.

</div>
### Summary
To summarize, Grealish preferred running inside from his left starting position. Players range of running direction angle can be described by using variaton. By examining these run patterns and variations, we gain insight into tactical roles, team structure, and interplay between players. Tracking data allow for moving beyond event statistics and increase our understanding of how individual movements impact the game.

I’d like to thank Pegah and David from Twelve for their guidance throughout this process!
