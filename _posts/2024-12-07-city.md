Through the soccermatics course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which led to this article where I analyse attack running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, I chose to investigate my favourite Jack Grealish! Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, and so they were in this match. In addition, I will describe the variation in run direction for all players in the match.

<div style="text-align:center;">

Grealish’s runs show a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes must provide width. Despite all his forward runs, Grealish had surprisingly few involements in Citys chance creation. Most of Citys chances were through the middle, resulting in no shot-assist, or shots for Grealish. Looking for valuable running actions, checking Grealish involvement when City did create chances can give information about his influence. Here is an example.
<div style="text-align:center;">

The video gives valuable context. This situasjon ended with a shot from De Bruyne (even if the ball diseapear). Ruben Dias continuing his run, after carrying the ball forward and passing to KDB. Grealish is running wide, and then keeping the width. The run from Grealish forces the defender(Darmian) to stay wide, which allow De Bruyne space and opportunity to move inwards, past Brozovic. This is one example of how a run can help adding space for a teammate without recieving the ball.   
### Run variation
Zooming out and looking at the whole team, Nathan Aké’s average wide run go wide. That can make sense, knowing Grealish often runs inside. Grealish starting his runs closer to the opposition goal than his counterpart Bernardo Silva on the right, creating a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns. With Silva operating deeper in midfield, the responsibility for stretching the opposition defence on the right side shifts. The average runs indicates De Bruyne, Akanji,and Stones share this task on their side, in addition to Haaland who runs in the middle. 
<div style="text-align:center;">

Back to Silva, watching him play give an impression from being sort of all over the pitch, wherever the space occurs. This impression is reflected, measuring variation in run direction. Of all players in the match, he is second only to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle of running directions, and visualized with wedges/cones for each player. High variation indicates a player running in a wider range of directions (Silva), which can add unpredictability to the team’s attack. Low variation suggests a more consistent, specialized running pattern (Lukaku).

By examining these run patterns and variations, we gain insights into tactical roles, team structure, and the interplay between players. Tracking data allows to move beyond simple stats and increase understanding how individual movements shape the game. Thanks to Pegah and David for guidance, through the process of using tracking data!
