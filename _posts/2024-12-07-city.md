### Using tracking data - analyzing runs 
------------
Through the soccermatics pro course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which led to this article where I analyse attack running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, I chose to investigate my favourite Jack Grealish! Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, so they were in this match.

Grealish’s runs indicate a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes must provide width.

Zooming out, Nathan Aké’s average wide run makes sense, knowing Grealish often runs inside. Starting his runs closer to the opposition goal than his counterpart Bernardo Silva on the right, Grealish creates a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns. With Silva operating deeper in midfield, the responsibility for stretching the opposition defence on the right side shifts. The average runs indicates De Bruyne, Akanji,and Stones share this task on their side.

Back to Bernardo Silva, watching him play give an impression from being sort of all over the pitch, wherever the space occurs. His high variation in run direction reflecting this impression. Of all players in the match, he is second only to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle of running directions, and visualized with wedges/cones for each player. High variation indicates a player running in a wider range of directions (Silva), which can add unpredictability to the team’s attack. Low variation suggests a more consistent, specialized running pattern (Lukaku).  High variation indicates players running in a wider range of directions. High variation indicates more unpredictability in their running patterns. Low variation means the run direction is more consistent.

The difference in run variation between Lukaku and his counterpart Lautaro Martínez is interesting. Lukaku’s low variation indicates he has a more specialized role, and Lautaro more flexible, making more runs in multiple directions. By examining these run patterns and variations, we gain insights into tactical roles, team structure, and the interplay between players. Tracking data allows us to move beyond simple stats and truly understand how individual movements shape the game.
