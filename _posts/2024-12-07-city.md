### Using tracking data - analyzing runs 
------------
The final task of the soccermatics pro asked us to analyze the attacking run patterns in the Champions League final 2023. It also gave an opportunity to work with tracking -data, which was a great experience. And there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, so I chose my favourite, Jack Grealish.  
Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealishâ€™s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, as we saw in the CL final (2023) against Inter Milan.
