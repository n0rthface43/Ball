### Using tracking data - analyzing runs 
------------
Through the soccermatics pro course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which led to this report where I analyse attack running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, I chose my favourite Jack Grealish. Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, so it was in this match.

Grealish’s runs indicate a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes must provide width.

Zooming out, Nathan Aké’s average wide run makes sense, knowing Grealish often runs inside. Starting his runs closer to the opposition goal than his counterpart Bernardo Silva on the right, Grealish creates a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns.

With Silva operating deeper in midfield, the responsibility for runs in behind shifts. On the right side, De Bruyne, Akanji, and Stones share this duty. Interestingly, Silva has one of the highest variations in run direction of all players, second only to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. We measure this variation using the standard deviation of run angles. High variation indicates a player who runs in many different directions, adding unpredictability to the team’s attack. Low variation suggests a more consistent, specialized running pattern. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle in run directions and visualized with wedges for each player. High variation indicates players running in a wider range of directions. High variation indicates more unpredictability in their running patterns. Low variation means the run direction is more consistent.

Romelu Lukaku have low variation in run direction. The difference in run variation between Lukaku and his counterpart Lautaro Martínez is interesting. Lukaku’s low variation indicates he has a more specialized role, and Lautaro more flexible, making more runs in multiple directions.
By examining these run patterns and variations, we gain insights into tactical roles, team structure, and the interplay between players. Tracking data allows us to move beyond simple stats and truly understand how individual movements shape the game.
