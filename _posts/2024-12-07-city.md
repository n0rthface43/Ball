Through the soccermatics course I got the opportunity to work with tracking data. A great experience which led to this article where I analyse running patterns in the Champions League final 2023 between Manchester City and Inter Milan. Since there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, I chose to investigate my favourite Jack Grealish! In addition to analysing Grealish's runs, a metric for variation in run direction will be described.
<div style="text-align:center;">

Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, and so they were in this final. According to the data from respovision, Grealish managed 11 forward runs (While City in possession) through the match. 
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8504e061-0758-4f61-9f7e-d6816372a193" alt="L4" style="max-width:80%;"/>

Grealish played as a left winger. His runs show a preference to run inside, starting from the left. Grealish's average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes has to provide width. Despite all his forward runs, Grealish had surprisingly few involements with the ball in City's chance creation. Most City's chances came with runs through the middle, or underlaps like Bernardo Silva did before Rodri's goal. Observing runs alone does not make sense. Observing Grealish runs when City did create a chance can give more valauble context to the contribution of his runs. Here is an example:
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e5d568-7488-4ed0-8b37-ef212187ac84" alt="L4" style="max-width:80%;"/>
</div>

This situation ended with a shot from De Bruyne (ball diseapearred, tracking data is not perfect yet:)). In this short sequence, Grealish's run help giving space for his teammate (KDB). Grealish is running wide, and keeping the width. Inter leftback (Darmian) does not want to pressure De Bruyne, knowing Grealish then will be free. Dias' run also takes attention from the defenders, which create more time for De Bruyne.  Brozovic is late, and De Bruyne gets enough space to move inside, for the shot.   
### Run direction variations
Looking at the whole team (figure below), Nathan Aké’s average run goes wide. That can make sense, knowing that Grealish often runs inside. Grealish starting his runs closer to the opposition goal than his counterpart Bernardo Silva on the right, creating a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns. With Silva operating deeper in midfield, the responsibility for stretching the opposition defence on the right side, shifts. The average runs indicate that Silva, De Bruyne, Akanji,and Stones share this task on their side, While Grealish is the one running closer to the offside-line on the left.
<div style="text-align:center;">

Back to Silva, he gives an impression of running wherever space occurs on the pitch. This impression is reflected in the variation metric. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle of running directions, and visualized with wedges/cones for each player. High variation indicates a player running in a wider range of directions (Silva), which can add unpredictability to the team’s attack. Low variation suggests a more consistent, specialized running pattern. 
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;">

Looking at players playing in similar roles, comparasion can give information about their style of play. Lukaku, with lower variation, running more consistently in same direction (towards goal). Haaland (Sorry for not avoiding him in this analysis:), running i a more wider angle of directions. This makes it more difficult for the defenders following him, but it also moves himself sometimes away from the centre.

By examining these run patterns and variations, we gain insight into tactical roles, team structure, and the interplay between players. Tracking data allows to move beyond simple statistics and increase our understanding of how individual movements impact the game.

I'd like to thank Pegah and David from Soccermatics for guidance through the process of using tracking data!
