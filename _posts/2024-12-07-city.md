### Using tracking data - analyzing runs 
------------
The final task of the soccermatics pro asked us to analyze the attacking run patterns in the Champions League final 2023. It also gave an opportunity to work with tracking -data, which was a great experience. And there is a tall blonde Norwegian in front at City, so I chose my favourite, Jack Grealish.  
Whether you like him or not, Jack Grealish’s abilities to create chances are special. His runs in attack are important for Manchester City, as we saw in the CL final (2023) against Inter Milan.

Grealish’s runs indicate a preference to run inside, starting from the left. His average run starts in the channel and moves towards the box. A few runs towards the sideline indicate that he sometimes must provide width.

Zooming out, Nathan Aké’s average wide run makes sense, knowing Grealish often runs inside. Starting his runs closer to goal than Bernardo Silva on the right, Grealish creates a form of asymmetry in City’s running patterns. Silva’s variation in run direction is second of all players in the match; Only Mkhitaryan has more mixed run directions. Variation is measured by using standard deviation of the angle in run directions and visualized with wedges for each player. High variation indicates players running in a wider range of directions, showing more unpredictability. Low variation means the run direction is more consistent. This could be due to players have a more specialized role in the team. This metric can be useful in evaluating playing style of both players and teams. Bernardo Silva for example has a high variation, which means his runs were in multiple directions. This observation supports the bias about him as a player that operates in a lot of spaces and moving all over the pitch.Noticing the difference in run variation between Lukaku and his counterpart Lautaro Martínez is interesting.  Lukaku’s low variation indicates he has a more specialized role, and Lautaro more flexible, making more runs in multiple directions.
