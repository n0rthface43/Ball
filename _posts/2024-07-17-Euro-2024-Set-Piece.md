Spain



Overall Spain won all their seven games. They ended up creating 12,9 expected goals. Far more than their final opponent England who only created a cumulative total of 6 through the whole tournament[Fbref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/676/stats/UEFA-Euro-Stats). Obviously playing more games then everyone else than England. When comparing to other teams, there is arguments for Spain not being superior going forward.

Spain got most credit because of their attack. And mainly their wingers Yamal and Williams, who delivered far more then expected.
