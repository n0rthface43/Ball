### A game analysis of Euro final Spain vs England
------------
Spain won, and most non-England supporters thought they deserved it(some England supporters too). After the final wistle, it felt like Spain just did what was expected. Actually they exceeded the expectation. Before the torunament they werent favourites. France and England were both given much better chances by the bookies in front of the torunament ([(BBC odds)](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cv22vrnl0j0o))
Considering that, that makes the way they won it more impressive. Overall, Spain won all their seven games. They ended up creating a total of 12,9 expected goals. Far more than their final opponent England, who only created a cumulative total of only 6 xG through the whole tournament [(Fbref)](https://fbref.com/en/comps/676/stats/UEFA-Euro-Stats) and they were according to the the media, for example the Athletic ["...head and shoulders above everyone else"](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5637944/2024/07/15/spain-euro-2024-win-yamal-williams-de-la-fuente/). So lets take a closer look on the final, and how convincinging Spain were.

Spain got most credit during the tournament because of their attack. The game was definately more busy for Jordan Pickford than Unai Simon. ![shots_teams](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65375bbd-5cd7-4281-b892-abea18413721). England struggled to create opportunities in the box, and Palmers goal was a little lucky. England definately have the quality to create and take the chances, but they really did not get the ball into good positions.

The passes into final third shows most passes are centrally, and a few on the right side, mainly for Bukayo Saka. England really struggled to progress on their left side. And their passes are typically straight forward, with an angle which can make it difficult for the reciever.

Spain had more passes into final third. England managed to keep them away from their box most of the time. There are really few passes directly into the box or nearby. Spain have a very fluid passes outside of the box, and more passes are angled, and a mix of vertical and horisontal passes. 

### The stars

Williams have been shining the whole tournament, so in the final. His ability to run with ball is extrordinary! His carries shows his ability to move with ball in feet, and he often manages to get into dangerous areas. So he did for his goal, and his finishing was brilliant.
![carries_player_lamineyamal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2715017c-2b7b-4214-85b7-8cf3b8c7eece)
Yamal, is same, but different. His skillset with more danger from crosses(and shots outside box, ref semifinal:)). Really valuable contributions in the final too. His carries is shorter, but his unpredictability makes him dangerous, and his involvement is high.    
![carries_player_bukayo_saka](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a60bab1-f177-4b1f-be15-9f38e7494ee7)
Saka is the only one close to match the Spain duo's numbers for carries. His carries is characteristicly from the right and inside. He did mangage some, but struggled to get into the really dangerous areas where we have seen him create and score for Arsenal this season. 


### Spain more able get into final third

Morata drops often deep. William and Yamal the most advanced players in possession. Olmo also important with lots of connections. Overall, Spain have plenty of the ball and are able to create combination all over the pitch. 

![England pass network](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686897a5-e28a-407a-9c85-613dba3e4b07)
The difference compared to Spain is clear with noone close to the final third, but Bukayo Saka. England really lacked the ability to attack from both centre and left. Both Kane and Belllingham became deep, and they didnt manage to get the ball in dangerous spaces behind or in front of the defence.
