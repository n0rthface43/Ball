Overall Spain won all their seven games. They ended up creating 12,9 expected goals. Far more than their final opponent England who only created a cumulative total of 6 xG through the whole tournament[Fbref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/676/stats/UEFA-Euro-Stats). Obviously playing more games then everyone else(except England). When comparing to other teams, there is arguments for Spain not being superior going forward. 
(cumulative expected goals xG ended up deserved their victory, and they were, according to the experts[The Athletic for example](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5637944/2024/07/15/spain-euro-2024-win-yamal-williams-de-la-fuente/);"...head and shoulders above everyone else".  

Spain got most credit because of their attack. The final was quiet in both six yard boxes, but more busy for Jordan Pickford than Unai Simon. ![Xg shotmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51274c26-2dd5-4ef2-9799-91957b800934)
