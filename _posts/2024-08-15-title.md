### A game analysis of Euro final Spain vs England
------------
Spain won, and you have to look good to argue they did not deserved it. Overall, Spain won all their seven games. They ended up creating a total of 12,9 expected goals. Far more than their final opponent England, who only created a cumulative total of only 6 xG through the whole tournament[Fbref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/676/stats/UEFA-Euro-Stats). Obviously playing more games then everyone else(except England). When comparing to other teams, there is arguments for Spain not being superior going forward. (cumulative expected goals xG ended up deserved their victory, and they were, according to the experts[The Athletic for example](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5637944/2024/07/15/spain-euro-2024-win-yamal-williams-de-la-fuente/);"...head and shoulders above everyone else".  
Spain got most credit because of their attack. The final was quiet in both six yard boxes, but definately more busy for Jordan Pickford than Unai Simon. ![shots_teams](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65375bbd-5cd7-4281-b892-abea18413721). England struggled to create opportunities in the box, and Palmers goal was a low chance. They definately have the quality to create and take the chances, but they really did not get the ball into good positions. And if we look closer, we can see that.

Figure 2 (Data from Statsbomb)
The passes into final third shows most passes are centrally, and a few on the right side, mainly for Bukayo Saka. England really struggled to progress on their left side. And their passes are typically straight forward, with an angle which can make it difficult for the reciever.

Figure 3 Spain passes into finalthird

Spain had more passes into final third. England managed to keep them away from their box most of the time. There are really few passes directly into the box or nearby. Spain have a very fluid passes outside of the box, and more passes are angled, and a mix of vertical and horisontal passes. 

The shining stars
![carries_player_nico_williams](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279dbbc0-a7ec-4ee7-ad29-4e6978e50368) 
Williams have been shining the whole tournament, so in the final. His ability to run with ball is extrordinary! His carries shows how often, and how far he is running, and he manage to get into dangerous areas too.

Same, but different. No words needed. Different skillset, but really valuable, also in the final. His carries is shorter, but his unpredictability makes him dangerous.

From England Saka is the only one close to match the Spain duo's numbers for carries.

And mainly their wingers Yamal and Williams, who delivered far more then expected. Their ability to hold the ball, and attach whereever the space occur made Spain unpredictable and dangerous.
