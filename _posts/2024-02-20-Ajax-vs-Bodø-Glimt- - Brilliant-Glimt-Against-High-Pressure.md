Bodø Glimt certainly put up an impressive performance against Ajax in the Conference League, and the 2-2 draw was quite entertaining. Let’s take a closer look at Bodø Glimts performance.
Let's start with the highlight of the game, the brilliant first goal. Here Glimt solve the pressure from Ajax with creating 3v2. That overload results in opportunity to pass forward. Then the timing of movement and passes between Berg and Grønbæk is perfect. Football at the highest level, pure class.

Glimt showed a mix of great tools, solving Ajax high pressure. Brice Wembangomo’s one-on-one ability going forward was crucial. Against Ajax’s high press, Wembangomo skillfully bypassed his marker and initiated entire attacks on his own. His dribbling forced Ajax to drop deeper, allowing Bodø Glimt to advance forward. Wembangomo’s skill in evading defenders is truly remarkable!

In addition to Wembangomos individual skills, Glimt effectively dealt with Ajax’s high pressing by finding space on the sides of Ajax’s midfield. They achieved this through direct passes to their central midfielders and overlapping runs from the fullbacks when Ajax’s defensive line was narrow. Prior to both of Glimt’s goals, there were passes through the lines to Grønbæk, who initiated the attacks. Additionally, Glimt’s center-backs engaged Ajax’s attackers during the press, freeing up a teammate.

In another instance, when Ajax pressed high, Glimt exploited space on their left side. Gundersen engaged Brobbey and Berghuis to press, and Berghuis positioned himself wide. Gundersen found a passing lane to Grønbæk with excellent timing, and Bjørkan made a well-timed run to receive the ball and drive toward Ajax’s defensive line. Notice how Hauge and Evjen stayed high, pinning Ajax’s fullback and center-back to prevent them from pressing.

Ajax pressed even higher in the next situation. Berghuis positioned himself narrower this time, creating space for Bjørkan. Glimt managed to escape the pressure, and the larger distances between Ajax players allowed for multiple opportunities. Berg was open for most of the sequence, and he created a great chance for Zugelj.

When Bodø Glimt pressed high (which was rare in this match), their front three stayed narrow. Evjen occasionally dropped into midfield, while the wingers pushed higher. This made it difficult for Ajax to find central spaces, where Glimt had more players controlling the game.

Overall, Glimt’s tactical awareness and execution were commendable, even though the final result might not have fully reflected their performance. It will be interesting to watch the secound leg.
